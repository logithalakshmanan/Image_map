    The Adyar River is a 42-kilometer-long river in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, that originates near Chembarambakkam Lake and flows east to meet the Bay of Bengal at the Adyar Estuary. It plays a crucial role in the city's drainage system by collecting water from various lakes and rainwater drains, although it has historically suffered from high pollution from urban and industrial waste. Efforts are underway for the river's ecological restoration, with the estuary designated as a protected wildlife reserve in 1987.
