    The largest and most premium film exhibitor in India with 1732 screens across 113 cities (India and Sri Lanka) with 363 properties and an aggregate seating capacity of 3.60 lakh seats. Over the years, we have consistently increased our screen count, both organically and inorganically, through strategic investments and acquisitions, which include 'Cinemax Cinemas' in November 2012, 'DT Cinemas' in May 2016, and SPI Cinemas' in August 2018. We recently completed the merger with INOX Leisure Limited, which has added to our storied history of becoming game changers in the film exhibition industry for over 25 years and transforming the out-of-home entertainment in the country.
